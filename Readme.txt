To install and run the script with python, the script will create a file named log.txt, 6slog.txt, and config.ini. Set your tf/maps file before running the file. 
if you have issues with the config.ini file you can just delete it and the script will rebuild it with default settings.
Log.txt contains the log from the previous run. 

Run the Run.py script. This will update create the log and ini files then download the maps using maplookup.py and sixslookup.py.
